*Tomato with eggs:

Material: Tomatoes, eggs, and onion.
Spicy: salt, sugar

just stir the eggs, then put the chopped tomatoes(any size is fine, just make it small) with the eggs together in the bowel. Normally,  I will put the eggs a little bit more than tomatoes, ex: 6 eggs with 4 tomatoes. You can also put some salt or sugars or both salt and sugars in the bowel. And stir it! Then fry some chopped piece-onion first on the pan, then put the eggs and tomatoes together!



*Paprika and pork (and the Gonbal chicken):

Material: pork(or beef, or chicken), paprika, onion or green onion, garlic, chili(for the Gonbal chicken), peanuts(for the Gobal chicken)
Spicy: salt, soya sauce

Chop the pork, the meat, into small pieces. And put the meats in the bowel. Put some soya sauce in the bowel, and mix the sauce and meat evenly. Wait for a while, like 10~20 mins. Fried the pieced onions first if you want to put some onions, then fried the meat. While the meat change the colors, put the chopped paprika on the pan. Add the green onion, garlic in the pan. Fried the meat and paprika with the biggest fire(since normally in Taiwan, we still use the real fire with the gas), and just wait for a while. Test the tasty during the cooking, and adjust it with some salts!

For the Gonbal chicken, basiclly, I do it with the similar procedure, but just cook the chicken first without frying the onions. Pick out all the chicken while all of that change the color(into the white). And fried the garlic(you can smell the garlic while you are just doing that), then put the meat back into the pan and fry it with chili powder. Better if you can cook with the real chili not the powder! When all the chicken are cooked, add some peanuts. And don't forget to test the tasty when u are cooking!
